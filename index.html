                    <h1>What are the features on a bugati divo?</h1>
                    <p>The car takes inspiration from the Bugatti Type 57SC Atlantic along 
                         with the Bugatti Vision Gran Turismo concept in terms of design
                          and has track performance as its main focus. The car includes
                           a redesigned exhaust system featuring quad exhaust pipes,
                            a 1.8 metre wide fixed rear wing (23% wider than the retractable
                             wing on the Chiron), a NACA duct on the roof that channels
                              air to the rear of the car on a central fin and ultimately
                               on the rear wing for improved downforce, a large front chin
                                spoiler, more refined side skirts, larger air intakes on
                                 the front, new head lamps and tail lamps, a vent in the
                                  bonnet for improved radiator cooling and vents on the
                                   front wheel arches to cool the brakes.

                        The interior in the Divo is relatively similar to the more
                         luxurious Chiron, but has Alcantara upholstery and carbon-fibre
                          trim in order to save weight.
                        
                        Other notable changes include stiffer springs and dampers,
                         carbon-fibre wiper blades and intercooler shroud, grooved
                          wheel spokes, reduced sound insulation, a lighter sound
                           system and removal of the storage lockers present in the
                            doors and centre console for a weight saving of 35 kg 
                            (77 lb) over the Chiron Sport. The engine, a quad-turbocharged
                             W16 unit, is retained from the Chiron along with the 7-speed
                              dual-clutch transmission.</p>

                        <h2>When was the bugati divo published?</h2>
                        <p>The production of the Divo is limited to 40 units and the car
                             will be built alongside the Chiron at the Bugatti factory.
                              All of the 40 cars were pre-sold before the public debut
                               to Chiron owners through special invitation by the dealers.
                                The Bugatti Divo sold out in its first day of availability
                               . In April 2020, Divo entered its final phase of testing
                                with deliveries beginning later in the year. On July 23,
                                 2021 the last Bugatti Divo was produced.</p>

                            <h3>What is the performance of a bugati divo?</h3>
                            <p>The car is 8.0 seconds quicker than the Chiron around the
                                 Nardò test track according to the manufacturer and generates
                                 456 kg (1,005 lb) of downforce at top speed, 90 kg (198 lb)
                                  more than the Chiron. The top speed is, however, reduced
                                  to 380 km/h (236 mph), owing to the extra drag produced by the
                                   aerodynamic elements and due to excessive pressure on the tyres
                                    resulting from a lower ride height. Power output is unchanged
                                     from the Chiron, with 1,103 kW (1,500 PS; 1,479 hp) at 6,700
                                      rpm and 1,600 N⋅m (1,180 lb⋅ft) of torque at from 2,000 to
                                       6,000 rpm. Acceleration from 0–100 km/h (62 mph) is also
                                        unchanged from the Chiron at 2.4 seconds but the Divo has 
                                        a higher lateral acceleration (1.6 g vs 1.5 g in the Chiron)
                                        . The Divo lacks the top speed mode unlocked with a special
                                         key as present on the Chiron. The Divo also has the record for 
                                         worst fuel efficiency.</p>

                                <h4>When was the bugati divo first seen?</h4>
                                <p>By: Anthony Alaniz
                                    Bugatti introduced the Divo in 2018, and today the company revealed the 
                                    first ones ready for delivery. According to the bespoke French automaker,
                                     “This marks the end of a challenging development lasting almost two years,”
                                      the results are stunning. For Bugatti, the Divo is more than just another
                                       hypercar, too. It signals something new.
                                    
                                    “The Divo starts a new era at Bugatti – the era of modern coachbuilding,”
                                     said company president Stephan Winkelmann, calling the car “a highly
                                      customized masterpiece of automotive craftsmanship.” This new era allows
                                       Bugatti to alter and customize the car’s underlying technology, which
                                        it did turning the Chiron into the Divo. Limiting the Divo’s top speed
                                        to 236 miles per hour (380 kilometers per hour) gave Bugatti liberties
                                         in its development.Winkelmann called the Divo “a visually and technically
                                          independent model.”You just have to look at the Divo to see that.
                                           The profile is slimmer, making it look “flatter and more sporty” than the
                                            Chiron. At the front, intakes on the hood reduce the vehicle’s surface
                                             area and improve airflow while a new spoiler generates more downforce.
                                              It also helps direct more air into the front intakes while also helping
                                               to cool the brakes. 

                                         The rear is branded with a unique 3D taillight design that features 44
                                          light-up fins that comprise the taillights. It’s a stunning complement
                                           to the narrow LED headlights up at the front. A NACA air duct on the
                                            roof helps feed air the Divo’s 8.0-liter W16 engine, which produces 
                                            1,500 horsepower (1,118 kilowatts). A fin extending from the intake 
                                            helps channel air over the wide wing, which sits above a raised diffuser
                                             and 3D-printed exhaust tips.Bugatti plans to build just 40 Divo hypercars
                                              to the tune of at least €5 million ($5.8 million) each. However, you won’t
                                              
                                              be able to buy one because all 40 examples are already sold. In fact,
                                               the Divo is so exclusive, it made our list of coolest cars on sale 
                                               this year for being the most expensive production car in the world.</p>
